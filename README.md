### The rules will be presented right when you execute the program but here's a rundown anyways
# Rules
- A 3x3 matrix with 0s and 1s allows you to flip any single element in it
- 'flip'ping means 0 converted to 1 or vice-versa
- You have to covnert the matrix into one with all elements being 1
- However with each flip, the elements horizontally and vertically adjacent to it get flipped as well

# Good Luck!
